# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
<p>Designed and developed an interactive tableau dashboard to analyze the impact of COVID-19 across the globe. Tried gaining insights about the total deaths, recovered and total positive cases. It tracks metrics such as death count, recovery rate, positivity rate, etc on country-level. I published my dashboard on Tableau Public.
